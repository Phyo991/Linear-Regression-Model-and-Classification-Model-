Customer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Overview
This repository contains a Python script for predicting customer categories using a supervised machine learning algorithm called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used in this project is related to a telecommunications provider that segments its customer base into four groups based on service usage patterns. The goal is to use demographic data to predict customer group membership. This is a classification problem where each customer is assigned one of four predefined labels corresponding to different service categories:

Basic Service
E-Service
Plus Service
Total Service
The KNN algorithm is employed for this task, which is capable of classifying new data points based on their similarity to existing data points.

Key Steps in the Code

Data Download and Exploration:
The code starts by downloading the dataset from a specified URL using the requests library and saving it as a CSV file.
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame to explore its contents and distribution of customer categories.
Data Preprocessing:

Feature selection: Relevant columns are selected from the dataset to create the feature matrix X.
Target selection: The target variable is extracted to create the target vector y.
Data normalization: The feature matrix X is normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and to improve the efficiency of gradient descent-based algorithms.
Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
KNN Model Building and Evaluation:

The code builds a KNN model with an initial value of k (number of neighbors) and evaluates its accuracy on both the training and testing sets.
It then proceeds to find the optimal k value by testing a range of k values and selecting the one that yields the highest accuracy on the test set.

Final Model and Predictions:
With the best k value determined, the code trains a final KNN model and uses it to make predictions on the testing data.
The accuracy of the final model is reported.

Instructions for Running the Code
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) installed.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script knn_classification.py.
Further Customization
You can customize the URL to download different datasets or adapt the code for different classification problems.
Experiment with different values of k and other hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

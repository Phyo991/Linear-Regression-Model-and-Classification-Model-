Predicting CO2 Emissions with Simple Linear Regression

Overview - This repository contains a Python script for predicting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from vehicles using a simple linear regression model. The dataset used in this project, "FuelConsumption.csv," contains information about vehicle characteristics such as engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict CO2 emissions based on a single feature: engine size.

Key Steps in the Code

Data Download:
The code starts by downloading the dataset from a specified URL using the requests library and saving it as a CSV file.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
A summary of the dataset is generated using the describe() function to provide an overview of key statistics.
A subset of features (engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions) is selected for further exploration.
Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of each feature.

Data Visualization:
Scatter plots are created to visualize the relationship between different features and CO2 emissions. This helps assess the linearity of the relationships.

Train-Test Split:
The dataset is randomly split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using a random mask.

Model Building:
A simple linear regression model is created using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class. The model is trained using the engine size as the independent variable and CO2 emissions as the dependent variable.

Model Visualization:
The fitted regression line is plotted over the training data to visualize how well the model fits the data points.

Model Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using the testing set. Metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and the R-squared (R2) score are calculated to assess the model's performance.


Customer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Overview-
This is predicting customer categories using a supervised machine learning algorithm called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used in this project is related to a telecommunications provider that segments its customer base into four groups based on service usage patterns. The goal is to use demographic data to predict customer group membership. This is a classification problem where each customer is assigned one of four predefined labels corresponding to different service categories:

Basic Service
E-Service
Plus Service
Total Service
The KNN algorithm is employed for this task, which is capable of classifying new data points based on their similarity to existing data points.

The data sources - "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/teleCust1000t.csv"

Key Steps in the Code

Data Download and Exploration:
The code starts by downloading the dataset from a specified URL using the requests library and saving it as a CSV file.
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame to explore its contents and distribution of customer categories.
Data Preprocessing:

Feature selection: Relevant columns are selected from the dataset to create the feature matrix X.
Target selection: The target variable is extracted to create the target vector y.
Data normalization: The feature matrix X is normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and to improve the efficiency of gradient descent-based algorithms.

Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

KNN Model Building and Evaluation:
The code builds a KNN model with an initial value of k (number of neighbors) and evaluates its accuracy on both the training and testing sets.
It then proceeds to find the optimal k value by testing a range of k values and selecting the one that yields the highest accuracy on the test set.

Final Model and Predictions:
With the best k value determined, the code trains a final KNN model and uses it to make predictions on the testing data.
The accuracy of the final model is reported.

Instructions for Running the Code
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) installed.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script knn_classification.py.
Further Customization
You can customize the URL to download different datasets or adapt the code for different classification problems.
Experiment with different values of k and other hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
